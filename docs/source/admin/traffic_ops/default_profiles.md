Traffic Ops - Default Profiles
==============================

Traffic Ops has the concept of rl-working-with-profiles, which are an
integral function within Traffic Ops. To get started, a set of default
Traffic Ops profiles need to be imported into Traffic Ops to get started
to support Traffic Control components Traffic Router, Traffic Monitor,
and Apache Traffic Server.
