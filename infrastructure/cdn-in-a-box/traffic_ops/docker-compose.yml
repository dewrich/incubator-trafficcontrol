# To use this compose you should first build Traffic Ops and then copy the RPM to :
#
# incubator-trafficcontrol/infrastructure/docker/traffic_ops/traffic_ops.rpm
#
# You should then just be able to go to the directory incubator-trafficcontrol/infrastructure/docker/traffic_ops/
# and type 'docker-compose up -d'
#
# You should then be able to go to https://localhost and test Traffic Ops or the go api.
# if you make code changes to the Go proxy then you just need to rebuild it and then
# restart Traffic Ops:
#
# bash -c "clear && docker exec trafficops_to_server_1 /bin/bash /etc/init.d/traffic_ops /bin/bash /etc/init.d/traffic_ops start; sleep 5"
